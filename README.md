## 🎮 What is Soulful Sessions?

Soulful Sessions gamifies your work sessions to help you stay focused and build better productivity habits. Complete timed focus sessions to earn rewards, level up your character, defeat bosses with meaningful backstories, and unlock cosmetic customizations.

### Core Concept

You play as a "Soul Shepherd" who helps guide "Stubborn Souls" (bosses) to find peace. Each focus session you complete deals damage to the current boss, and defeating them reveals their story and resolution. As you progress, you earn experience (Soul Insight) and currency (Soul Embers) to upgrade your character and unlock cosmetics.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Productivity Tools
- **Pomodoro-Style Sessions** - Customizable focus timers (5-120 minutes)
- **Automatic Break Timers** - Configurable break durations with notifications
- **Idle Detection** - Tracks when you're away from your computer during sessions
- **Task Management** - Create goals, tasks, and subtasks with estimated durations
- **Auto-Completion** - Optionally mark tasks complete when sessions end
- **Smart Duration** - Session duration auto-fills based on selected task
- **Strict Mode** - Block distracting websites during focus sessions
- **Statistics Tracking** - Monitor streaks, total focus time, and progress

### 🎮 RPG Mechanics
- **Level Progression** - Earn Soul Insight (XP) to level up
- **Character Stats** - Upgrade Spirit (damage), Harmony (crit chance), Soulflow (idle rewards)
- **Boss Battles** - Defeat 10 unique Stubborn Souls, each with their own story
- **Idle Collection** - Earn passive Soul Embers even when not in sessions
- **Critical Hits** - Chance to deal 1.5x damage based on Harmony stat
- **Session Quality** - Compromised sessions (too much idle time) reduce rewards

### 🎨 Customization
- **6 Themes** - Unlock beautiful color schemes (300-10,000 Soul Embers)
- **4 Character Sprites** - Customize your Soul Shepherd appearance (2,000-15,000 Soul Embers)
- **Animation Toggles** - Enable/disable UI animations
- **Notification Settings** - Control alerts and sound volume

## 🎭 The Stubborn Souls

Each boss represents a soul with unfinished business. As you defeat them, you engage in meaningful conversations and help them find peace:

1. **The Restless Athlete** (100 resolve) - A runner chasing an unreachable finish line
2. **The Unfinished Scholar** (250 resolve) - A researcher seeking one more source
3. **The Regretful Parent** (600 resolve) - A parent who missed milestones
4. **The Forgotten Artist** (1,400 resolve) - A painter whose masterpiece was never seen
5. **The Lonely Musician** (3,200 resolve) - A composer whose symphony was never performed
6. **The Devoted Gardener** (7,000 resolve) - A botanist whose seed never bloomed
7. **The Ambitious Inventor** (15,000 resolve) - An engineer whose breakthrough was stolen
8. **The Wandering Explorer** (32,000 resolve) - A traveler who never reached the summit
9. **The Silent Poet** (65,000 resolve) - A writer whose words were burned
10. **The Eternal Guardian** (130,000 resolve) - A protector who failed their final duty

### Architecture

**State Management:**
- Single source of truth in `StateManager`
- Immutable state updates via `updateState(partial)`
- Persistence to `chrome.storage.local`
- State validation on load

**Message Passing:**
- Background service worker handles all state mutations
- Popup/options send messages via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
- Background broadcasts updates to all clients
- Request-response pattern with async/await

**Manager Separation:**
- **StateManager**: Storage and retrieval
- **SessionManager**: Session timing and lifecycle
- **ProgressionManager**: XP and boss mechanics
- **RewardCalculator**: Reward formulas
- **IdleCollector**: Passive rewards
- **NavigationMonitor**: Site tracking

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm test:unit

# Integration tests (requires Chrome/Chromium)
npm test:integration

# Watch mode
npm test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

- Unit tests for individual managers (StateManager, SessionManager, etc.)
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Manual testing checklists in `src/test-*.md` files

### Manual Testing

Load the extension in developer mode and test:

1. **Basic Session Flow**
   - Start a session → Complete → View rewards → Start break
   - Emergency end session (reduced rewards)
   - Idle detection during session

2. **Boss Progression**
   - Deal damage to boss
   - Defeat boss → View conversation → See resolution
   - Progress to next boss

3. **Stat Upgrades**
   - Upgrade Spirit/Harmony/Soulflow
   - Verify cost increases exponentially
   - Check stat effects on rewards

4. **Cosmetics**
   - Purchase themes and sprites
   - Apply cosmetics
   - Verify visual changes

5. **Task Management**
   - Create goals, tasks, subtasks
   - Start session with task selected
   - Auto-complete task on session end

6. **Strict Mode**
   - Add sites to blocked list
   - Start session with strict mode
   - Verify sites are blocked
   - Check blocked page appears
