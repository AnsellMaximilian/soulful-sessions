# Product Overview

**Soulful Sessions** (Soul Shepherd) is a Chrome extension that gamifies productivity by combining focus session tracking with RPG mechanics.

## Core Concept

Users complete timed focus sessions to earn rewards and progress through a game where they defeat "Stubborn Souls" (bosses) while building their character stats.

## Key Features

- **Focus Sessions**: Pomodoro-style work sessions with idle detection and site blocking
- **RPG Progression**: Level up, earn Soul Insight (XP) and Soul Embers (currency)
- **Boss Battles**: Defeat Stubborn Souls by completing focus sessions
- **Character Stats**: Spirit (damage), Harmony (crit chance), Soulflow (idle collection)
- **Idle Collection**: Earn passive rewards when not in sessions
- **Strict Mode**: Block distracting sites during focus sessions
- **Cosmetics**: Unlock themes and character sprites with earned currency
- **Task Management**: Track goals, tasks, and subtasks

## User Flow

1. User starts a focus session with a duration and optional task
2. Extension monitors activity (idle detection, navigation tracking)
3. Session ends → rewards calculated → boss damage applied
4. Break timer starts automatically
5. During breaks, users can upgrade stats, purchase cosmetics, or start next session
